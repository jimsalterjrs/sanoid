<img src="http://openoid.net/gplv3-127x51.png" width=127 height=51 align="right">Sanoid is a policy-driven snapshot management tool for ZFS filesystems.  When combined with the Linux KVM hypervisor, you can use it to make your systems <a href="http://openoid.net/transcend" target="_blank">functionally immortal</a>.  

<p align="center"><a href="https://youtu.be/ZgowLNBsu00" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.openoid.net/sanoid_video_launcher.png" alt="sanoid rollback demo" title="sanoid rollback demo"></a><br clear="all"><sup>(Real time demo: rolling back a full-scale cryptomalware infection in seconds!)</sup></p>

More prosaically, you can use Sanoid to create, automatically thin, and monitor snapshots and pool health from a single eminently human-readable TOML config file at /etc/sanoid/sanoid.conf.  (Sanoid also requires a "defaults" file located at /etc/sanoid/sanoid.defaults.conf, which is not user-editable.)  A typical Sanoid system would have a single cron job:
```
* * * * * /usr/local/bin/sanoid --cron
```

And its /etc/sanoid/sanoid.conf might look something like this:

```
[data/home]
	use_template = production
[data/images]
	use_template = production
	recursive = yes
	process_children_only = yes
[data/images/win7]
	hourly = 4

#############################
# templates below this line #
#############################

[template_production]
        hourly = 36
        daily = 30
        monthly = 3
        yearly = 0
        autosnap = yes
        autoprune = yes
```

Which would be enough to tell sanoid to take and keep 36 hourly snapshots, 30 dailies, 3 monthlies, and no yearlies for all datasets under data/images (but not data/images itself, since process_children_only is set).  Except in the case of data/images/win7-spice, which follows the same template (since it's a child of data/images) but only keeps 4 hourlies for whatever reason.

##### Sanoid Command Line Options

+ --cron

 	This will process your sanoid.conf file, create snapshots, then purge expired ones.

+ --configdir

	Specify a location for the config file named sanoid.conf. Defaults to /etc/sanoid

+ --take-snapshots

	This will process your sanoid.conf file, create snapshots, but it will NOT purge expired ones. (Note that snapshots taken are atomic in an individual dataset context, <i>not</i> a global context - snapshots of pool/dataset1 and pool/dataset2 will each be internally consistent and atomic, but one may be a few filesystem transactions "newer" than the other.)

+ --prune-snapshots

	This will process your sanoid.conf file, it will NOT create snapshots, but it will purge expired ones.

+ --monitor-snapshots

	This option is designed to be run by a Nagios monitoring system. It reports on the health of your snapshots.

+ --monitor-health

	This option is designed to be run by a Nagios monitoring system. It reports on the health of the zpool your filesystems are on. It only monitors filesystems that are configured in the sanoid.conf file.

+ --force-update

	This clears out sanoid's zfs snapshot listing cache. This is normally not needed.

+ --version

	This prints the version number, and exits.

+ --quiet

	Supress non-error output.

+ --verbose

	This prints additional information during the sanoid run.

+ --debug

	This prints out quite alot of additional information during a sanoid run, and is normally not needed.

# Syncoid

Sanoid also includes a replication tool, syncoid, which facilitates the asynchronous incremental replication of ZFS filesystems.  A typical syncoid command might look like this:

```
syncoid data/images/vm backup/images/vm
```

Which would replicate the specified ZFS filesystem (aka dataset) from the data pool to the backup pool on the local system, or

```
syncoid data/images/vm root@remotehost:backup/images/vm
```

Which would push-replicate the specified ZFS filesystem from the local host to remotehost over an SSH tunnel, or

```
syncoid root@remotehost:data/images/vm backup/images/vm
```

Which would pull-replicate the filesystem from the remote host to the local system over an SSH tunnel.

Syncoid supports recursive replication (replication of a dataset and all its child datasets) and uses mbuffer buffering, lzop compression, and pv progress bars if the utilities are available on the systems used.

##### Syncoid Command Line Options

+ [source]

	This is the source dataset. It can be either local or remote.

+ [destination]

	This is the destination dataset. It can be either local or remote.

+ -r --recursive

	This will also transfer child datasets.

+ --compress <compression type>

	Currently accepted options: gzip, pigz-fast, pigz-slow, lzo (default) & none. If the selected compression method is unavailable on the source and destination, no compression will be used.

+ --source-bwlimit <limit t|g|m|k>

	This is the bandwidth limit imposed upon the source. This is mainly used if the target does not have mbuffer installed, but bandwidth limites are desired.

+ --target-bw-limit <limit t|g|m|k>

	This is the bandwidth limit imposed upon the target. This is mainly used if the source does not have mbuffer installed, but bandwidth limites are desired.

+ --no-command-checks

	Do not check the existance of commands before attempting the transfer. It assumes all programs are available. This should never be used.

+ --no-stream

	This argument tells syncoid to use -i incrementals, not -I. This updates the target with the newest snapshot from the source, without replicating the intermediate snapshots in between. (If used for an initial synchronization, will do a full replication from newest snapshot and exit immediately, rather than starting with the oldest and then doing an immediate -i to the newest.)

+ --no-sync-snap

	This argument tells syncoid to restrict itself to existing snapshots, instead of creating a semi-ephemeral syncoid snapshot at execution time. Especially useful in multi-target (A->B, A->C) replication schemes, where you might otherwise accumulate a large number of foreign syncoid snapshots.

+ --dumpsnaps

	This prints a list of snapshots during the run.

+ --sshport

	Allow sync to/from boxes running SSH on non-standard ports.

+ --sshkey

	Use specified identity file as per ssh -i.

+ --quiet

	Supress non-error output.

+ --debug

	This prints out quite alot of additional information during a sanoid run, and is normally not needed.

+ --version

	Print the version and exit.

+ --monitor-version

	This doesn't do anything right now.

Note that the sync snapshots syncoid creates are not atomic in a global context: sync snapshots of pool/dataset1 and pool/dataset2 will each be internally consistent, but one may be a few filesystem transactions "newer" than the other.  (This does not affect the consistency of snapshots already taken in other ways, which syncoid replicates in the overall stream unless --no-stream is specified. So if you want to manually zfs snapshot -R pool@1 before replicating with syncoid, the global atomicity of pool/dataset1@1 and pool/dataset2@1 will still be intact.)
