- This package needs to be a 3.0 (quilt) format, not 3.0 (native).
  - Fix the changelog
  - Move the packaging out to a separate repository, or at a minimum,
    a separate branch.
- Provide an extended description in debian/control
- Figure out a plan for sanoid.defaults.conf.  It is not supposed to be
  edited, so it shouldn't be installed in /etc.  At a minimum, install
  it under /usr and make a symlink, but preferably patch sanoid to look
  there directly.
- Man pages are necessary for all the utilities installed.
  - With these, there is probably no need to ship README.md.
- Break out syncoid into a separate package?
