FreeBSD users will need to change the Perl shebangs at the top of the executables from #!/usr/bin/perl 
to #!/usr/local/bin/perl in most cases.

Sorry folks, but if I set this with #!/usr/bin/env perl as suggested, then nothing works properly
from a typical cron environment on EITHER operating system, Linux or BSD.  I'm mostly using Linux
systems, so I get to set the shebang for my use and give you folks a FREEBSD readme rather than
the other way around. =)

If you don't want to have to change the shebangs, your other option is to drop a symlink on your system:

root@bsd:~# ln -s /usr/local/bin/perl /usr/bin/perl

After putting this symlink in place, ANY perl script shebanged for Linux will work on your system too.
