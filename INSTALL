SYNCOID-RSYNC
-------
This rsync-resumable variant of syncoid depends on the following commands being in the system path:
rsync, pkill, rm, test, cat, rsync, scp, pgrep

SSH is required only for remote synchronization.

It will optionally utilize the following if available, just like the base syncoid:
ssh, pv, gzip, pigz, lzop, and mbuffer

To "install":
* place the "syncoid" file in /usr/local/bin
chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/syncoid

Please see the base syncoid's INSTALL for further notes about installing 
these, etc.
