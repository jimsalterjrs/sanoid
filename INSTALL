SYNCOID
-------
Syncoid depends on ssh, pv, gzip, lzop, and mbuffer.  It can run with reduced
functionality in the absence of any or all of the above. SSH is only required
for remote synchronization.  On newer FreeBSD and Ubuntu Xenial
chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com, on other distributions arcfour crypto is the
default for SSH transport since v1.4.6. Syncoid runs will fail if one of them
is not available on either end of the transport.

On Ubuntu: apt install pv lzop mbuffer
On CentOS: yum install lzo pv mbuffer lzop perl-Data-Dumper
On FreeBSD: pkg install pv mbuffer lzop

FreeBSD notes: FreeBSD may place pv and lzop in somewhere other than
               /usr/bin ; syncoid currently does not check path.

               Simplest path workaround is symlinks, eg:
               root@bsd:~# ln -s /usr/local/bin/lzop /usr/bin/lzop
               or similar, as appropriate, to create links in /usr/bin
               to wherever the utilities actually are on your system.

               See note about mbuffer in FREEBSD.readme


SANOID
------
Sanoid depends on the Perl module Config::IniFiles and will not operate
without it.  Config::IniFiles may be installed from CPAN, though the project
strongly recommends using your distribution's repositories instead.

On Ubuntu: apt install libconfig-inifiles-perl
On CentOS: yum install perl-Config-IniFiles
On FreeBSD: pkg install p5-Config-IniFiles
